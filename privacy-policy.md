# Privacy Policy — Query Params Manager

**Last updated:** February 10, 2026

## Overview

Query Params Manager is a Chrome extension that lets you view, edit, add, remove, and encode/decode URL query parameters. This policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## Data Collection

Query Params Manager does **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any user data. Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No URLs are stored or sent to any server
- No analytics or tracking scripts are used
- No cookies are set
- No third-party services are used
- No user accounts are required

## How the Extension Works

The extension reads the URL of your currently active tab **only** when you click the extension icon. This URL is parsed locally within the extension popup to display query parameters. All processing happens entirely within your browser. No data ever leaves your device.

## Permissions

The extension uses a single permission:

- **activeTab** — Grants temporary access to the current tab when you click the extension icon. This is used to read the tab's URL and to navigate the tab to an updated URL when you apply changes. No access is granted to any other tabs or browsing data.

## Data Storage

The extension does not use local storage, sync storage, cookies, or any other persistence mechanism. No data is retained between sessions.

## Third Parties

The extension does not communicate with any external servers, APIs, or third-party services. It operates entirely offline within your browser.

## Children's Privacy

The extension does not collect any data from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date.
